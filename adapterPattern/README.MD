# Plugging Devices into Power Outlets

This project demonstrates the **Adapter Design Pattern** by simulating the plugging of different devices into a standard power outlet. Since each device has unique power requirements and interfaces, adapters are created to allow them to connect safely and uniformly through a common interface.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
Electronic devices such as laptops, refrigerators, and smartphones have different plug types, voltage, and amperage requirements. To ensure **compatibility** and **safety**, we need a way to standardize how these devices connect to a power outlet without modifying the device itself.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Solution
We use the **Adapter Design Pattern**, where each device has its own adapter that allows it to connect to a **PowerOutlet** interface.  

- **Target (Interface):**
  - `PowerOutlet` â†’ defines the common method `plugIn()`.

- **Adaptee (Existing Objects):**
  - `Laptop` â†’ method: `charge()`
  - `Refrigerator` â†’ method: `startCooling()`
  - `SmartphoneCharger` â†’ method: `chargePhone()`

- **Adapter (Bridge between Target & Adaptee):**
  - `LaptopAdapter` â†’ translates `plugIn()` â†’ `charge()`
  - `RefrigeratorAdapter` â†’ translates `plugIn()` â†’ `startCooling()`
  - `SmartphoneAdapter` â†’ translates `plugIn()` â†’ `chargePhone()`

- **Client:**
  - `Main` â†’ demonstrates the use of adapters to connect devices to the `PowerOutlet`.

## ðŸ“‚ UML Class Diagram
The following UML diagram shows the relationships between the **Target**, **Adapters**, **Adaptees**, and the **Client**:

> The diagram includes:
> - **PowerOutlet** interface with `plugIn()`.
> - **Adapters** (`LaptopAdapter`, `RefrigeratorAdapter`, `SmartphoneAdapter`) implementing the interface.
> - **Adaptees** (`Laptop`, `Refrigerator`, `SmartphoneCharger`) with their specific methods.
> - **Client (Main)** which uses the adapters through the `PowerOutlet` interface.
